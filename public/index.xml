      <description>What is Git? Git is Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). Where from security point of view, it provides:
 Audit trail, answering who did what, why, and when Recovery, allowing to revert to previous working state Backup, where each client has a full back of repository and its history Integrity, everything is check-summed with SHA-1 non-repudiation, where every change has a valid owner Separation of Duty, where author introduces the change and committer accepts the change  It supports a non-linear development (branches), simple, very fast, and everything stored as stream of snapshots.</description>
